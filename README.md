# Matplotlib Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you can easily navigate through the 'Pymaceuticals' folder by focusing on the main code 'pymaceuticals_starter', and accessing the resource files (CSV files) within the 'data' folder. I crafted this script using Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, and scipy.stats in both VS Code and Jupyter Notebook. As you execute each cell of the code, the results will be displayed dynamically.

# Written Analysis
Upon analyzing the mouse lab testing data for specific drug regimens, my primary observation is that Capomulin and Ramicane exhibit lower overall Mouse Tumor Volume, with Ramicane having the lowest. Additionally, it is evident that these two drugs were the most frequently observed in our mouse subjects, while Propriv had the least observations. Another noteworthy point is the slight majority of male mice among our test subjects, with a marginal 2% difference compared to female mice.
